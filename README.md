# Pokémon Emerald

This is a decompilation of Pokémon Emerald, forked from [pret](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald).

I've made some modifications on the `pureemerald` branch that improve the Emerald experience to my taste, including balancing, quality of life changes, and the ability to catch all Pokémon in the Hoenn dex without the need for trading.

I plan to add some more minor tweaks, and to make a proper new rom hack on another branch to give a whole new experience.
